This repository contains the GitHub documentation for Innate Technologies, an organization specializing in the development of quantum technologies, including quantum teleportation.

## Quantum Teleportation

Quantum teleportation is a technique for transmitting quantum information from one location to another, without physically transmitting the quantum states themselves. The basic idea is to use two entangled particles, known as a Bell pair, to transfer information between two locations. By making a measurement on one of the particles, the other particle is instantaneously affected, allowing for the transfer of information.

At Innate Technologies, we are constantly working to improve the techniques and technologies used in quantum teleportation. Our work in this area includes the development of software, hardware, and protocols for the implementation of quantum teleportation in a variety of settings.
